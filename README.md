<img src="/GRAPHICS/Theory/Assets/fun.png" alt="CPP" width="800" />


Welcome to **CPP-Hub**, where we take C++ from "Hello, World!" to "Wow, this is actually useful!" 🎉 Whether you're just starting out or trying to impress interviewers with mind-bending STL wizardry, this repo has you covered.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository is neatly packed with handpicked C++ goodness:

### 🧠 DSA - Data Structures & Algorithms
- **NEETCODE 250** - because solving problems builds character
- Multiple solutions with time-space trade-offs (choose wisely)
- Thought process breakdowns (no magic, just logic)
- Clean, well-commented code - your future self will thank you!

### 📘 CPP CONCEPTS - From "What is C++?" to "I write C++ in my sleep"  
- **Beginner Basics** - syntax, loops, and why semicolons matter 😅
- **OOP** - classes, inheritance, and making things unnecessarily complicated
- **Memory Management** - pointers and how to avoid segfault-induced heartbreak
- **Advanced C++** - templates, metaprogramming, and why your compiler hates you
- **Modern C++** - all the cool new stuff from C++11 to C++23 (useful, we swear)
- **Practical Examples** - because theory without code is just philosophy

### 🎨 GRAPHICS - Making Pretty Things with C++
- **OpenGL & Vulkan** - draw stuff on the screen, feel like a wizard 🧙‍♂️
- **Shader Programming** - GLSL, HLSL, and bending light to your will
- **Mesh-Slicing & Layering** - because 3D rendering is just advanced pizza cutting

### ⚡ Bonus Sections
- **Concurrency & Parallelism** - more threads, more problems
- **Competitive Programming** - speedrun your way to a coding job
- **Design Patterns** - impress people with fancy architecture terms
- **Game Development** - turn your C++ skills into an actual fun project

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone this beast: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPP-Hub.git`
2. Pick a section, any section
3. Run the code, break it, fix it, repeat
4. Brag about your newfound C++ mastery

## 💡 How to Use This Repo
- **Newbie?** Start with **CPP CONCEPTS** and work your way up.
- **Interview Prep?** The **DSA** section is your best friend.
- **Graphics Nerd?** Jump straight to **GRAPHICS** and make cool stuff.
- **Want to flex?** Try the **Advanced C++** section and suffer with the rest of us.

# 🚀 CPP-Hub: The Ultimate C++ Learning Repository

<img src="./GRAPHICS/Theory/Assets/cpp.png" alt="CPP" width="800" />


Welcome to **CPP-Hub**, where we take C++ from "Hello, World!" to "Wow, this is actually useful!" 🎉 Whether you're just starting out or trying to impress interviewers with mind-bending STL wizardry, this repo has you covered.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository is neatly packed with handpicked C++ goodness:

### 🧠 DSA - Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Topic-wise Questions** - organized by arrays, trees, graphs, and more
- **Company-wise Questions** - curated sets for top tech interviews
- Multiple solutions with time-space trade-offs (choose wisely)
- Thought process breakdowns (no magic, just logic)
- Clean, well-commented code - your future self will thank you!

### 📘 CPP CONCEPTS - From "What is C++?" to "I write C++ in my sleep"  
- **Beginner Basics** - syntax, loops, and why semicolons matter 😅
- **OOP** - classes, inheritance, and making things unnecessarily complicated
- **Memory Management** - pointers and how to avoid segfault-induced heartbreak
- **Advanced C++** - templates, metaprogramming, and why your compiler hates you
- **Modern C++** - all the cool new stuff from C++11 to C++23 (useful, we swear)
- **Practical Examples** - because theory without code is just philosophy

### 🎨 GRAPHICS - Making Pretty Things with C++
- **OpenGL** - draw stuff on the screen, feel like a wizard 🧙‍♂️

### 🏆 COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING - Codeforces Questions
- **Codeforces Problem Sets** - handpicked questions from various contests
- **Difficulty Levels** - sorted by ratings
- **Editorials & Solutions** - detailed explanations and multiple approaches (where available)

> Some problem sets and resources in this section are inspired by [TLE Eliminators CP Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet). Check them out for more curated content!


## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone this beast: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPP-Hub.git`
2. Pick a section, any section
3. Run the code, break it, fix it, repeat
4. Brag about your newfound C++ mastery

## 💡 How to Use This Repo

- **New to C++?** Start with **CPP CONCEPTS** and let the semicolons gently break your spirit (but build you up again).
- **Interview Panic Mode?** The **DSA** section is your lifeline—cram, solve, repeat, and hope the interviewer asks about arrays.
- **Competitive Programming Addict?** The **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING** section is here for you—because sleep is overrated and rating is everything.
- **Graphics Wizard Wannabe?** Skip straight to **GRAPHICS** and make your computer draw things that will confuse your friends and impress your cat.

*Pick your adventure. May your bugs be few and your segfaults educational!*

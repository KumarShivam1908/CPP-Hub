# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Statement
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Intuition
The key insight to solve this problem is using a **sliding window** approach:
- Maintain a window containing only unique characters
- Expand the window when we find new characters
- Contract the window when we encounter duplicates
- Track the maximum window size throughout the process

## Approach
1. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current window
2. Use a HashSet to track characters currently in the window
3. Move the right pointer to expand the window
4. If a duplicate is found, remove characters from the left until the duplicate is eliminated
5. Calculate the maximum window size at each step

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string
    - Each character is processed at most twice (once by right pointer and once by left pointer)
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(m, n)) where m is the size of the character set
    - In the worst case, we store min(string length, total possible unique characters) in the HashSet

## Code Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
        int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
                // Initialize left and right pointers for our sliding window
                int l = 0;
                int r = 0; 
                int maxLength = 0; // Track the maximum window size found
                
                // HashSet to track unique characters in current window
                unordered_set<char> stringset;
                
                // Iterate through the string with right pointer
                for(r = 0; r < s.size(); r++) {
                        // If current character already exists in our window
                        while(stringset.find(s[r]) != stringset.end()) {
                                // Remove the leftmost character and move left pointer
                                stringset.erase(s[l]);
                                l++;
                        }
                        
                        // Add current character to our set
                        stringset.insert(s[r]);
                        
                        // Update maximum length if current window is larger
                        maxLength = max(maxLength, r-l+1);
                }

                return maxLength;
        }
};
```

## Dry Run
Let's trace the algorithm with example: s = "abcabcbb"

| Step | Action | Left | Right | Set | Window | Max Length |
|------|--------|------|-------|-----|--------|------------|
| 1 | Initialize | 0 | 0 | {} | "" | 0 |
| 2 | Add 'a' | 0 | 0 | {a} | "a" | 1 |
| 3 | Add 'b' | 0 | 1 | {a,b} | "ab" | 2 |
| 4 | Add 'c' | 0 | 2 | {a,b,c} | "abc" | 3 |
| 5 | Found 'a' again | 1 | 3 | {b,c,a} | "bca" | 3 |
| 6 | Found 'b' again | 2 | 4 | {c,a,b} | "cab" | 3 |
| 7 | Found 'c' again | 3 | 5 | {a,b,c} | "abc" | 3 |
| 8 | Add 'b' | 3 | 6 | {a,b,c,b} | "abcb" | 3 |
| 9 | Found 'b' again | 5 | 7 | {b} | "b" | 3 |

Final answer: 3

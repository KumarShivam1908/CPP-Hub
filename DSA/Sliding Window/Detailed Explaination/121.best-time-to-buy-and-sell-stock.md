### Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

### Constraints
- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

## Intuition
The key insight for this problem is that we want to buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest price afterward. We can use a sliding window approach with two pointers:
- Left pointer (L) tracks the day we would buy (looking for minimum price)
- Right pointer (R) scans ahead looking for the best day to sell

The maximum profit is determined by the maximum difference between a future selling price and the current minimum buying price.

## Approach
We initialize our left pointer (L) and right pointer (R) at the first day. Then, we move R through the array:
1. If the price at R is higher than at L, we calculate the potential profit
2. If the price at R is lower than at L, we update L to R (as we found a better day to buy)
3. Continue until we've checked all possible selling days

## Solution with Detailed Comments

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        // Initialize two pointers and the maximum profit variable
        int L = 0;              // L points to the day we buy (looking for minimum price)
        int R = 0;              // R points to the day we sell (looking for maximum price after L)
        int maxProfit = 0;      // Stores the maximum profit found so far
        
        // Loop through all days
        while(R < prices.size()) {
            // If buying price is less than selling price, we have a potential profit
            if(prices[L] < prices[R]) {
                // Calculate current profit
                int profit = prices[R] - prices[L];
                // Update maxProfit if current profit is higher
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, profit);
            } else {
                // If current price is lower than our buying price
                // Update buying position to current position
                // This is key - we always want to buy at the lowest price
                L = R;
            }
            // Move the selling position to the next day
            R++;
        }
        
        // Return the maximum profit found
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

## Dry Run

Let's trace through the algorithm using the example: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`

1. Initialize: `L = 0, R = 0, maxProfit = 0`
2. Loop iterations:
   - Iteration 1: `L = 0, R = 0`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `7 < 7` (false)
     - Update `L = R = 0`
     - Increment `R = 1`
   - Iteration 2: `L = 0, R = 1`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `7 < 1` (false)
     - Update `L = R = 1`
     - Increment `R = 2`
   - Iteration 3: `L = 1, R = 2`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `1 < 5` (true)
     - Calculate profit: `5 - 1 = 4`
     - Update `maxProfit = max(0, 4) = 4`
     - Increment `R = 3`
   - Iteration 4: `L = 1, R = 3`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `1 < 3` (true)
     - Calculate profit: `3 - 1 = 2`
     - Update `maxProfit = max(4, 2) = 4`
     - Increment `R = 4`
   - Iteration 5: `L = 1, R = 4`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `1 < 6` (true)
     - Calculate profit: `6 - 1 = 5`
     - Update `maxProfit = max(4, 5) = 5`
     - Increment `R = 5`
   - Iteration 6: `L = 1, R = 5`
     - Check `prices[L] < prices[R]`: `1 < 4` (true)
     - Calculate profit: `4 - 1 = 3`
     - Update `maxProfit = max(5, 3) = 5`
     - Increment `R = 6`
   - End of array, loop terminates

3. Return `maxProfit = 5`

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(n)** 
- We only go through the price array once with our two pointers

**Space Complexity: O(1)** 
- We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size

# Majority Element

## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Intuition
Since the majority element appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in the array, we can use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each element. Once we find an element whose count exceeds ⌊n/2⌋, we can immediately return it as the majority element.

## Approach
1. Create a hashmap to store the count of each element in the array.
2. Iterate through the array and increment the count for each element.
3. After incrementing the count, check if the element's count exceeds ⌊n/2⌋.
4. If an element's count exceeds ⌊n/2⌋, return that element.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, as the hashmap might need to store counts for all unique elements in the array.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        // create a hashmap to store the count of each element
        unordered_map<int,int> countMap;
        // iterate through the array and count the occurrences of each element
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            //countMap[nums[i]]++ does two things:
            // If nums[i] is not in the map, it inserts it with a default value of 0 (thanks to C++'s behavior)
            // Then increments the value by 1
            countMap[nums[i]]++; // increment the count of the current element
            
            // if the count of the current element is greater than half the size of the array, return it
            if(countMap[nums[i]] > nums.size()/2){
                return nums[i];
            }
        }
        return -1; // this line will never be reached, but is needed to avoid compilation error
    }
};
```

## Follow-up
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

> Note: For the follow-up question, consider using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm which allows solving this problem with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

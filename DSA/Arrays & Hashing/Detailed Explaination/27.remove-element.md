## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

## Intuition

The problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value from an array and return the count of remaining elements. There are several approaches to this problem:

1. **Create a new array (current solution)**: We can create a new array to store all elements that are not equal to the target value, then replace the original array with this new one.

2. **Two-pointer approach**: We can use two pointers to avoid using extra space, overwriting elements that equal the target value.

For this explanation, we'll focus on the current solution while mentioning the alternative.

## Algorithm

1. Create a new empty array (`res`).
2. Iterate through each element in the original array.
3. If the current element is not equal to the target value, add it to the new array.
4. Replace the original array with the new array.
5. Return the size of the new array.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the input array. We need to iterate through each element of the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, as we're creating a new array that might hold all elements from the original array.

> Note: An in-place solution using two pointers would have O(1) space complexity.

## Dry Run

Let's walk through the example: `nums = [3,2,2,3]`, `val = 3`

### Initial state:
- `nums = [3,2,2,3]`
- `val = 3`
- `res = []`

### Iteration 1:
- `nums[0] = 3` which equals `val`, so skip
- `res = []`

### Iteration 2:
- `nums[1] = 2` which doesn't equal `val`
- Add to `res`
- `res = [2]`

### Iteration 3:
- `nums[2] = 2` which doesn't equal `val`
- Add to `res`
- `res = [2,2]`

### Iteration 4:
- `nums[3] = 3` which equals `val`, so skip
- `res = [2,2]`

### Final state:
- Set `nums = res = [2,2]`
- Return `res.size() = 2`

## Code Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        vector<int> res;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]!=val){
                res.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        nums = res;
        return res.size();
    }
};
```

## Alternative Approach: Two-Pointer Method

A more efficient solution would use a two-pointer approach:
- Use a pointer `k` to track the position where non-val elements should be placed
- Iterate through the array with another pointer
- When finding non-val elements, place them at position `k` and increment `k`
- Return `k` as the new length

This approach achieves O(1) space complexity by doing the removal in-place.

## Constraints

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100

## Problem Description
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "([])
Output: true
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

## Intuition
The key insight to solve this problem is to use a stack data structure:
- When we encounter an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), we push it onto the stack
- When we encounter a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), we check if the stack is empty or if the top element is the corresponding opening bracket
- If the stack is empty or the top doesn't match, the string is invalid
- If it matches, we pop the top element and continue
- After processing all characters, the stack should be empty for a valid string

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(const string& s) {
        stack<char> st;
        const map<char, char> mp = {
            {')', '('},
            {']', '['},
            {'}', '{'}
        };
        
        for(char c : s) {
            if (c == '(' || c == '[' || c == '{') {
                st.push(c);
            } else {
                if (st.empty() || st.top() != mp.at(c)) {
                    return false;
                }
                st.pop();
            }
        }
        return st.empty();
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case where all characters are opening brackets.

## Dry Run
Let's walk through example 2: s = "()[]{}"

1. Character '(':
   - It's an opening bracket, push onto stack
   - Stack: ['(']

2. Character ')':
   - It's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of stack
   - Top of stack is '(', which matches ')'
   - Pop from stack
   - Stack: []

3. Character '[':
   - It's an opening bracket, push onto stack
   - Stack: ['[']

4. Character ']':
   - It's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of stack
   - Top of stack is '[', which matches ']'
   - Pop from stack
   - Stack: []

5. Character '{':
   - It's an opening bracket, push onto stack
   - Stack: ['{']

6. Character '}':
   - It's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of stack
   - Top of stack is '{', which matches '}'
   - Pop from stack
   - Stack: []

7. After processing all characters, the stack is empty.
   - Return true

Let's try example 3: s = "(]"

1. Character '(':
   - It's an opening bracket, push onto stack
   - Stack: ['(']

2. Character ']':
   - It's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of stack
   - Top of stack is '(', which doesn't match ']' (should be '[')
   - Return false

The algorithm correctly identifies valid and invalid parentheses strings!

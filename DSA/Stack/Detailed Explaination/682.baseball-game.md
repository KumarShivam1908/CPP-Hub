# 682. Baseball Game

## Problem Statement

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer x: Record a new score of x.
- '+': Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- 'D': Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- 'C': Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

## Intuition

This problem is a perfect fit for a stack data structure because:
- We need to track scores in order
- We need quick access to the most recent scores (for '+' and 'D' operations)
- We need to remove the most recent score (for 'C' operation)

A stack provides O(1) time complexity for all these operations with its LIFO (Last In, First Out) property.

## Approach

1. Create an empty stack to store the scores
2. Process each operation in the given order:
    - If the operation is an integer, convert it to a number and push it onto the stack
    - If the operation is 'C', pop the top element from the stack
    - If the operation is 'D', push double the top element onto the stack
    - If the operation is '+', get the top two elements, calculate their sum, and push it onto the stack
3. Calculate the sum of all elements in the stack and return it

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the operations array. We process each operation once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where all operations add a new score to the stack.

## Dry Run

Let's trace through the example: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]

| Operation | Action | Stack After Operation | Explanation |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| "5" | Push 5 | [5] | Add 5 to the record |
| "2" | Push 2 | [5, 2] | Add 2 to the record |
| "C" | Pop | [5] | Remove the previous score (2) |
| "D" | Push 2*5 | [5, 10] | Add double of previous score (5*2=10) |
| "+" | Push 5+10 | [5, 10, 15] | Add sum of two previous scores (5+10=15) |

Final stack: [5, 10, 15]
Sum of all scores: 5 + 10 + 15 = 30

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
     int calPoints(vector<string>& operations) {
          stack<int> st;

          for(int i = 0; i < operations.size(); i++) {
                if(operations[i] == "C") {
                     // Remove the previous score
                     st.pop();
                } else if(operations[i] == "D") {
                     // Add double of previous score
                     int top = st.top();
                     st.push(top * 2);
                } else if(operations[i] == "+") {
                     // Add sum of previous two scores
                     int last = st.top();
                     st.pop();
                     int secondLast = st.top();
                     st.push(last);  // Push back the last element
                     st.push(last + secondLast);  // Push the sum
                } else {
                     // Convert string to integer and push
                     st.push(stoi(operations[i]));
                }
          }
          
          // Calculate sum of all elements in stack
          int total = 0;
          while(!st.empty()) {
                total += st.top();
                st.pop();
          }
          return total;
     }
};
```

Note: The original code had a `sum(st)` function call which isn't defined in the snippet. I've included the sum calculation directly in the solution.

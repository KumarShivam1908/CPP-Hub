## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Intuition

In a binary tree, an **inorder traversal** visits nodes in the following order:
1. First, visit the left subtree
2. Then, visit the root node
3. Finally, visit the right subtree

This traversal produces values in a sorted order for Binary Search Trees (BSTs).

## Approach 1: Recursive Solution

### Explanation
The recursive approach follows the natural definition of inorder traversal:
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the current node
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void inorderHelper(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& result) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return;
        }
        
        inorderHelper(root->left, result);
        result.push_back(root->val);
        inorderHelper(root->right, result);
    }
    
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        inorderHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack
  - Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)
  - Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

## Approach 2: Iterative Solution

### Explanation
The iterative approach uses a stack to simulate the recursion:
1. Keep going to the left child and push each node onto the stack
2. When we can't go further left, pop from the stack, visit the node, and go to the right child
3. Repeat until the stack is empty and there are no more nodes to process

### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        stack<TreeNode*> stack;
        TreeNode* current = root;
        
        while (current != nullptr || !stack.empty()) {
            // Go all the way to the left
            while (current != nullptr) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current->left;
            }
            
            // Process the node and go to the right
            current = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            result.push_back(current->val);
            current = current->right;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
  - Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)
  - Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

## Dry Run: Iterative Approach

Let's trace through the iterative approach with the example: `[1,null,2,3]` which forms this tree:
```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```

Execution steps:

1. Initialize: `result = []`, `stack = []`, `current = 1`
2. Enter while loop (`current != null`)
   - Enter inner while loop
   - Push 1 to stack: `stack = [1]`
   - `current = 1->left = null`, exit inner while
   - Pop from stack: `current = 1`, `stack = []`
   - Add to result: `result = [1]`
   - `current = 1->right = 2`
3. Enter while loop (`current != null`)
   - Enter inner while loop
   - Push 2 to stack: `stack = [2]`
   - `current = 2->left = 3`
   - Push 3 to stack: `stack = [2,3]`
   - `current = 3->left = null`, exit inner while
   - Pop from stack: `current = 3`, `stack = [2]`
   - Add to result: `result = [1,3]`
   - `current = 3->right = null`
4. Enter while loop (`stack not empty`)
   - Skip inner while loop (`current = null`)
   - Pop from stack: `current = 2`, `stack = []`
   - Add to result: `result = [1,3,2]`
   - `current = 2->right = null`
5. Exit while loop (`current = null` and `stack empty`)

Final result: `[1,3,2]`

This matches the expected output for Example 1.

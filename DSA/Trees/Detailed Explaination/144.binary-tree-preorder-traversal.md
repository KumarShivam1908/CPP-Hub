# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [1,2,4,5,6,7,3,8,9]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## What is Preorder Traversal?

Preorder traversal is a depth-first tree traversal algorithm that follows this pattern:
1. Visit the current node (root)
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

The pattern is: **Root → Left → Right**

## Approach 1: Recursive Solution

### Intuition
The recursive approach directly implements the definition of preorder traversal. We process the current node, then recursively traverse the left subtree, and finally recursively traverse the right subtree.

### Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void Helper(TreeNode* root, vector<int> & res){
        if (root==nullptr)
        {
            return;
        }
        res.push_back(root->val);    // Visit the root
        Helper(root->left,res);      // Traverse left subtree
        Helper(root->right,res);     // Traverse right subtree
    }
    
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> res;
        Helper(root,res);
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This represents the maximum recursion stack depth. In the worst case (skewed tree), h can be O(n).

### Dry Run
Let's trace through the algorithm with the tree: `[1,2,3]` where 2 is the left child and 3 is the right child of 1.

1. Start at root (1)
   - Add 1 to result: `[1]`
   - Recursively call Helper on left child (2)
     - Add 2 to result: `[1,2]`
     - Recursively call Helper on left child of 2 (null) → Return
     - Recursively call Helper on right child of 2 (null) → Return
   - Recursively call Helper on right child (3)
     - Add 3 to result: `[1,2,3]`
     - Recursively call Helper on left child of 3 (null) → Return
     - Recursively call Helper on right child of 3 (null) → Return

Final Output: `[1,2,3]`

## Approach 2: Iterative Solution

### Intuition
The iterative solution uses a stack to simulate the recursion. We visit the current node, push its right child to the stack (to be processed later), and move to the left child. When there's no left child, we pop from the stack to get the next node to process.

### Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> res;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;

        TreeNode* curr = root;
        while(curr != nullptr || !s.empty()){
            if(curr != nullptr){
                res.push_back(curr->val);  // Visit the current node
                s.push(curr->right);       // Push right child (to be processed later)
                curr = curr->left;         // Move to left child
            }else{
                curr = s.top();            // No left child, process the right child
                s.pop();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, representing the maximum size of the stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), h can be O(n).

### Dry Run
Let's trace through the algorithm with the tree: `[1,2,3]` where 2 is the left child and 3 is the right child of 1.

1. Initialize: `res = []`, `s = []`, `curr = 1`
2. While loop (curr = 1):
   - Add 1 to result: `res = [1]`
   - Push right child (3) to stack: `s = [3]`
   - Move to left child: `curr = 2`
3. While loop (curr = 2):
   - Add 2 to result: `res = [1,2]`
   - Push right child (null) to stack: `s = [3,null]`
   - Move to left child: `curr = null`
4. While loop (curr = null):
   - Pop from stack: `curr = null`, `s = [3]`
   - Pop again: `curr = 3`, `s = []`
5. While loop (curr = 3):
   - Add 3 to result: `res = [1,2,3]`
   - Push right child (null) to stack: `s = [null]`
   - Move to left child: `curr = null`
6. While loop (curr = null):
   - Pop from stack: `curr = null`, `s = []`
   - Stack empty, loop ends

Final Output: `[1,2,3]`

## Follow-up
The problem mentions that the recursive solution is trivial and asks for an iterative approach, which we've provided above. The iterative approach is valuable because it avoids potential stack overflow issues with deeply nested trees.

# Palindrome Linked List

## Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

## Examples
**Example 1:**

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/pal2linked-list.jpg)
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^5].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9

## Intuition
To check if a linked list is a palindrome, we need to compare elements from the beginning with elements from the end. In a singly linked list, we can't easily traverse backwards, so we can:

1. Find the middle of the linked list using the "tortoise and hare" approach (slow and fast pointers)
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list
3. Compare the first half with the reversed second half
4. If all values match, it's a palindrome

## Approach
1. Use two pointers: slow moves one step at a time, fast moves two steps at a time
2. When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle
3. Reverse the list from the middle to the end
4. Compare elements from the start with elements from the reversed second half

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - we traverse the list at most twice
    - O(n/2) to find the middle
    - O(n/2) to reverse the second half
    - O(n/2) to compare the two halves
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use a constant amount of extra space

## Code Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
        bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
                // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list using slow/fast technique
                ListNode * slow = head;
                ListNode * fast = head;

                while(fast && fast->next){
                        slow = slow->next;       // Slow pointer moves 1 step
                        fast = fast->next->next; // Fast pointer moves 2 steps
                }

                // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
                ListNode * prev = nullptr;
                while(slow){
                        ListNode *temp = slow->next; // Store next node before changing pointer
                        slow->next = prev;           // Reverse pointer to point to previous node
                        prev = slow;                 // Update previous to current node
                        slow = temp;                 // Move to next node in original list
                }

                // Step 3: Compare first half with reversed second half
                ListNode* left = head;           // Pointer to original first half
                ListNode* right = prev;          // Pointer to reversed second half
                while(right){                    // Only need to check until end of second half
                        if(left->val != right->val){ // If values don't match, not a palindrome
                                return false;
                        }
                        left = left->next;
                        right = right->next;
                }

                // If we reach here, all values matched - it's a palindrome
                return true;
        }
};
```

## Follow-up Question
**Q: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?**
**A:** Yes, the solution above already satisfies both requirements. We use constant extra space while achieving linear time complexity through the three-step approach.

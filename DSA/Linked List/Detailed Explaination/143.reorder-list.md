You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [1,4,2,3]

**Example 2:**

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Intuition

The problem asks us to reorder the linked list by alternating nodes from the beginning and end of the list. We can break this down into three main steps:

1. **Find the middle of the linked list** - We can use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node.
2. **Reverse the second half of the linked list** - Once we have the middle, we reverse the second half.
3. **Merge the two halves alternately** - Finally, we merge the first half with the reversed second half.

This approach allows us to solve the problem in-place with O(n) time complexity.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // Edge case: if list is empty or has only one node
        if (!head || !head->next) return;
        
        // STEP 1: Find the middle of the linked list using slow and fast pointers
        // - slow moves one step at a time
        // - fast moves two steps at a time
        // When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        // STEP 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        // Example: 1->2->3->4->5 becomes 1->2->3 and 5->4
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = slow;
        while (curr) {
            // Store next node before we change pointers
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
            // Reverse the link
            curr->next = prev;
            // Move prev and curr forward
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        
        // STEP 3: Merge the two halves alternately
        // First half starts at head, second half starts at prev (head of reversed second half)
        ListNode* first = head;
        ListNode* second = prev;
        
        while (second->next) {
            // Save the next nodes of both lists
            ListNode* temp1 = first->next;
            ListNode* temp2 = second->next;
            
            // Connect first node to the head of reversed second half
            first->next = second;
            // Connect second node to the next node in the first half
            second->next = temp1;
            
            // Move pointers forward
            first = temp1;
            second = temp2;
        }
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity: O(n)** 
  - Finding the middle: O(n/2)
  - Reversing the second half: O(n/2)
  - Merging the two halves: O(n/2)
  - Overall: O(n)

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size
  - The reordering is done in-place by manipulating the pointers

# Merge Two Sorted Lists - LeetCode 21

## Problem Description
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.
Merge the two lists into one sorted list by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Intuition
When dealing with two already sorted linked lists, we can create a merged sorted list efficiently by:
- Comparing the current nodes from both lists
- Selecting the smaller node to add to our result list
- Moving forward in the list from which we took the node
- Repeating until we exhaust one of the lists

This is similar to the merge step in the merge sort algorithm, where we combine two sorted arrays.

## Approach
1. Create a dummy node to simplify handling the head of our result list
2. Maintain a pointer to track the current position in our result list
3. While both lists have nodes remaining:
    - Compare values and attach the smaller node to our result
    - Move forward in the list from which we took the node
    - Advance our result pointer
4. Once one list is exhausted, attach the remaining nodes from the non-empty list
5. Return the merged list (excluding the dummy node)

## Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
    public:
         ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
              // Create a dummy node as the starting point of our result list
              // This eliminates the need for special handling of the first node
              ListNode dummy(0);
              
              // 'current' will track the last node in our growing result list
              ListNode* current = &dummy;
              
              // Continue processing while there are nodes in both lists
              while (list1 && list2) {
                    // Compare the values of the current nodes in both lists
                    if (list1->val < list2->val) {
                         // If list1's node has smaller value, add it to our result
                         current->next = list1;
                         // Move forward in list1
                         list1 = list1->next;
                    } else {
                         // If list2's node has smaller or equal value, add it to our result
                         current->next = list2;
                         // Move forward in list2
                         list2 = list2->next;
                    }
                    
                    // Advance our pointer in the result list
                    current = current->next;
              }
              // At this point, at least one of the lists is empty
              if(list1) {
                    // If there are remaining nodes in list1, append them to the result
                    current->next = list1;
              } else {
                    // If there are remaining nodes in list2, append them to the result
                    current->next = list2;
              }
         }
    };
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m) where n and m are the lengths of list1 and list2 respectively.
  We process each node exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
  We're reusing the existing nodes and only creating one dummy node.

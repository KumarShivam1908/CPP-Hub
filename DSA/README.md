## Development Environment Setup

### VS Code LeetCode Extension

For a seamless coding experience, this repository was developed using the **LeetCode extension for Visual Studio Code**. This powerful extension allows you to:

- Browse LeetCode problems directly within VS Code
- Code and submit solutions without leaving your editor
- Test your solutions against example test cases
- Track your progress and submission statistics
- Easily organize solutions by difficulty and categories

This setup significantly streamlines the problem-solving workflow and eliminates the need to switch between browser and code editor.

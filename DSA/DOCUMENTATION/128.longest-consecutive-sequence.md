## Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints
- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Solution

### Intuition
The key insight to solve this problem efficiently is to use a hash set for O(1) lookups. For each number, we check if it's the start of a sequence (meaning its predecessor doesn't exist in the array), and then count how many consecutive numbers follow it.

### Approach
1. Store all numbers in a hash set for O(1) lookups
2. Iterate through each number in the set
3. For each number, check if it's the starting point of a sequence (no number-1 in set)
4. If it is a starting point, count consecutive numbers following it
5. Update the maximum length found

### Code

public:
    /**

     *

    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Create an unordered set to store unique elements from the array
        unordered_set<int> numset(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
        int lcs = 0;  // Variable to keep track of the longest consecutive sequence
        int cur = 0;  // Variable to store the length of the current sequence
    
        // Iterate through each unique number in the set
        for (auto num : numset) {
            // Check if 'num' is the starting point of a sequence
            // A number is the start of a sequence if there is no smaller number before it
            if (numset.find(num - 1) == numset.end()) {
                cur = 1;  // Start a new sequence with this number
                
                // Continue checking if the next consecutive number exists in the set
                while (numset.find(num + 1) != numset.end()) {
                    cur++;  // Increase the count of the current sequence
                    num++;  // Move to the next number in the sequence
                }
                
                // Update the longest sequence length found so far
                lcs = max(lcs, cur);
            }
        }
    
        // Return the length of the longest consecutive sequence found
        return lcs;
    }
};
// @lc code=end
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Building the hash set takes O(n) time
  - The outer loop runs at most n times (once for each number)
  - The inner while loop might seem to add more complexity, but each number is visited at most twice (once in the outer loop and possibly once in a while loop)
  - Overall, we process each number a constant number of times, resulting in O(n)
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We store all unique numbers in the hash set

### Dry Run
Let's trace through the algorithm with the first example: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`

1. Create hash set: `{100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}`
2. Iterate through each number:
   - For 100:
     - Check if 99 exists in set? No -> 100 is the start of a sequence
     - Start with sequence length = 1
     - Check if 101 exists in set? No -> sequence ends
     - Current longest = 1
   - For 4:
     - Check if 3 exists in set? Yes -> 4 is not the start of a sequence, skip
   - For 200:
     - Check if 199 exists in set? No -> 200 is the start of a sequence
     - Start with sequence length = 1
     - Check if 201 exists in set? No -> sequence ends
     - Current longest = 1
   - For 1:
     - Check if 0 exists in set? No -> 1 is the start of a sequence
     - Start with sequence length = 1
     - Check if 2 exists? Yes -> sequence length = 2
     - Check if 3 exists? Yes -> sequence length = 3
     - Check if 4 exists? Yes -> sequence length = 4
     - Check if 5 exists? No -> sequence ends
     - Current longest = 4
   - For 3:
     - Check if 2 exists in set? Yes -> 3 is not the start of a sequence, skip
   - For 2:
     - Check if 1 exists in set? Yes -> 2 is not the start of a sequence, skip

3. Final result: 4

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
2. Return `k`.

### Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```cpp
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Set Approach

#### Intuition
A set automatically stores only unique elements. Since we need to find all unique elements in the array, we can use a set to quickly obtain them. After getting all unique elements, we can place them back into the original array in order.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Create a set to store unique elements
        set<int> uniqueElements(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int pointer = 0;
        // Copy elements from set back to the array
        for(int num : uniqueElements) {
            nums[pointer++] = num;
        }
        return uniqueElements.size();
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Insertion into a set takes O(log n) time, and we're doing it n times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - In the worst case, all elements are unique and we store them all in the set.

### 2. Two Pointer Approach

#### Intuition
Since the array is already sorted, all duplicates will be adjacent to each other. We can use two pointers to track unique elements:
- A slow pointer (`i`) that keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed
- A fast pointer (`j`) that scans through the array to find unique elements

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        // TWO POINTER APPROACH
        int i = 0; // Slow pointer - position to place next unique element
        int j = 0; // Fast pointer - scans through the array
        int n = nums.size();

        while(j < n) {
            nums[i] = nums[j]; // Place the current element at the slow pointer
            
            // Skip all duplicates of the current element
            while(j < n && nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            
            i++; // Move slow pointer to next position
        }
        return i; // i represents the number of unique elements
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the array once with the two pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

### Comparison of Approaches

The two-pointer approach is superior for this problem because:
1. It achieves better time complexity (O(n) vs O(n log n))
2. It uses constant space (O(1) vs O(n))
3. It modifies the array in-place as required by the problem statement

The set approach, while simpler to implement, introduces unnecessary overhead in both time and space complexity.

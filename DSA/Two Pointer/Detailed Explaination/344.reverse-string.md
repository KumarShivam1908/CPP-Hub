Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.

## Intuition

The key insight to solving this problem is to use the **Two Pointer Technique**. Since we need to reverse the string in-place (without using extra space):

1. Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning of the string (`left`) and one at the end (`right`).
2. Swap the characters at these two pointers.
3. Move the left pointer one step forward and the right pointer one step backward.
4. Repeat until the pointers meet or cross each other.

This approach efficiently reverses the string because we're effectively swapping the first character with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on, until we reach the middle of the string.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.size()-1;

        while (left < right) {
            swap(s[left], s[right]);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the length of the string. We process each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use two pointers regardless of input size, and the swapping is done in-place without requiring any extra space.

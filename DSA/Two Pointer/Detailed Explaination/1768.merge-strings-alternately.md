## Problem Statement

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
**Output:** "apbqcr"
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
```
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

### Example 2:

**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
**Output:** "apbqrs"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

### Example 3:

**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
**Output:** "apbqcd"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Intuition

The problem asks us to merge two strings by alternating their characters. This is a classic scenario for using the **two-pointer technique**:

1. We maintain two pointers, one for each string
2. In each iteration, we add one character from each string to our result
3. Once we've gone through the shorter string, we append the remaining characters from the longer string

## Solution 1: Using Two Pointers with While Loops

```cpp
#include<string>
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result;
        int i = 0; // pointer to word1
        int j = 0; // pointer to word2
        
        // Merge characters alternately until one string is exhausted
        while(i < word1.size() && j < word2.size()) {
            result.push_back(word1[i]);
            result.push_back(word2[j]);
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        
        // Append remaining characters from word1 (if any)
        while(i < word1.size()) {
            result.push_back(word1[i]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // Append remaining characters from word2 (if any)
        while(j < word2.size()) {
            result.push_back(word2[j]);
            j++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: Using a For Loop

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result;
        
        // Merge characters alternately and handle remaining characters
        for(int i = 0; i < max(word1.size(), word2.size()); i++) {
            if(i < word1.size()) {
                result += word1[i];
            }
            if(i < word2.size()) {
                result += word2[i];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m)
- Where n is the length of word1 and m is the length of word2
- We traverse through both strings at most once

**Space Complexity:** O(n + m)
- We need to store the merged string with all characters from both input strings
- No additional data structures are used beyond the result string

# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Problem Statement
Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. The indices of these two numbers should be returned as an integer array `[index1, index2]`, where **1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length**.

The problem guarantees **exactly one solution**, and we must use **only constant extra space**.

## **Algorithm**
1. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = numbers.size() - 1`.
2. While `left < right`:
   - Compute `currsum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]`.
   - If `currsum > target`, decrease `right` (move towards smaller values).
   - If `currsum < target`, increase `left` (move towards larger values).
   - If `currsum == target`, return `[left + 1, right + 1]` (since the array is 1-indexed).
3. The loop will always find a valid answer, so no need to return a default value.

## **Code Implementation**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = numbers.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int currsum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            
            if (currsum > target) {
                right--; // Reduce the sum by moving right pointer left
            } else if (currsum < target) {
                left++; // Increase the sum by moving left pointer right
            } else {
                return {left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-based indexing
            }
        }
        
        return {-1, -1}; // This line will never be reached as per problem constraints
    }
};
```

## **Time Complexity Analysis (TC)**
- The algorithm **iterates through the array at most once**, as each step either increments `left` or decrements `right`.
- **Best case:** The answer is found in the first iteration (**O(1)**).
- **Worst case:** We traverse the entire array once (**O(N)**), where `N` is the size of `numbers`.
- **Overall Complexity:** **O(N)** (linear time)

## **Space Complexity Analysis (SC)**
- We are using **only two extra variables** (`left` and `right`), which take **O(1) constant space**.
- No additional data structures are used.
- **Overall Complexity:** **O(1)** (constant space)

## **Intuition**
Since the array is already sorted, we can leverage the **two-pointer technique** to find the two numbers efficiently. The main idea is:

1. **Initialize two pointers:** One at the start (`left = 0`) and one at the end (`right = numbers.size() - 1`).
2. **Calculate the sum of the numbers at these pointers**:
   - If the sum is **greater** than the target, move the `right` pointer left (decrease `right`) to reduce the sum.
   - If the sum is **less** than the target, move the `left` pointer right (increase `left`) to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is **equal** to the target, return the indices **(1-based)**.

Since there is exactly **one solution**, we are guaranteed to find the correct pair.

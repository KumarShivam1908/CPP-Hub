## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

### Constraints
- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m, n <= 200
- 1 <= m + n <= 200
- -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9

## Intuition

The key insight for this problem is to use a two-pointer approach. Since both arrays are already sorted, we can compare elements from each array and place them in order.

There are two main ways to approach this:
1. Using extra space (as shown in the provided solution)
2. Working in-place by filling nums1 from the end

The optimal approach is the second one, as it avoids using extra space and takes advantage of the fact that nums1 has reserved space at the end.

## Approach

### Approach 1: Using Extra Space
The provided solution creates a new array to store the merged result and then copies it back to nums1. While this works, it requires O(m+n) extra space.



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        vector<int> result; // Start with an empty vector
        int num1_start = 0, num2_start = 0;

        // Merge two sorted arrays
        while (num1_start < m && num2_start < n) {
            if (nums1[num1_start] <= nums2[num2_start]) {
                result.push_back(nums1[num1_start++]);
            } else {
                result.push_back(nums2[num2_start++]);
            }
        }

        // Add remaining elements from nums1
        while (num1_start < m) {
            result.push_back(nums1[num1_start++]);
        }

        // Add remaining elements from nums2
        while (num2_start < n) {
            result.push_back(nums2[num2_start++]);
        }

        // Copy back to nums1
        nums1 = result;
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: In-place Merge (Optimal)
A more efficient approach is to fill nums1 from the end:
1. Start with pointers at the end of the actual elements in nums1 and nums2
2. Compare elements and place the larger one at the end of nums1
3. Move backwards until all elements are processed


### Optimal Solution (In-place)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1;     // Last element in nums1
        int j = n - 1;     // Last element in nums2
        int k = m + n - 1; // Last position in merged array
        
        // Merge from the end
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
            } else {
                nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
            }
        }
        
        // If there are remaining elements in nums2
        while (j >= 0) {
            nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
        }
        // No need to handle remaining elements in nums1
        // as they are already in the correct position
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
Both approaches have O(m+n) time complexity as we need to process all elements from both arrays exactly once.

### Space Complexity
- Approach 1 (provided solution): O(m+n) extra space for the result vector
- Approach 2 (optimal in-place): O(1) extra space as we only use pointers

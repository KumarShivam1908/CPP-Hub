# Valid Palindrome II

## Problem Statement
Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

## Intuition
This problem can be solved using the two-pointer approach:

1. Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the string.
2. Compare characters at both pointers:
    - If they match, move the pointers toward each other (left++ and right--).
    - If they don't match, we have two options: skip the character at left OR skip the character at right.
3. When we encounter a mismatch, we check if the remaining string (after skipping one character) is a palindrome.
4. If either option results in a palindrome, we return true.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
     bool isPalindrome(string s){
          int l = 0 , r = s.size() - 1;
          while(l < r){
                if(s[l] != s[r]){
                     return false;
                }
                l++;
                r--;
          }
          return true;
     }
     bool validPalindrome(string s) {
          int l = 0 ;
          int r = s.size()-1;

          while(l < r ){
                if(s[l] != s[r]){
                     return isPalindrome(s.substr(0,l)+s.substr(l+1)) || isPalindrome(s.substr(0,r)+s.substr(r+1));
                }
                l++;
                r--;
          }
          return true;
     }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the length of the string. In the worst case, we need to traverse almost the entire string twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) due to the substring operations. A more optimized approach would avoid creating substrings and just pass indices to the helper function.

Note: The implementation using substring operations (`s.substr()`) is not the most efficient. A better approach would be to pass the indices directly to the helper function to avoid creating new strings.

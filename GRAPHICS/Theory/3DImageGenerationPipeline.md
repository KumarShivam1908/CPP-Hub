# **Rasterization Pipeline: Turning 3D Models into Pixels**

Alright, letâ€™s talk about **rasterization**â€”the process that takes a 3D scene and turns it into the 2D image on your screen. If youâ€™ve ever wondered how video games, animations, or interactive graphics actually get displayed, this is the magic behind it!

## Goal
To understand the stages between 3D models and the final 2D image on your screen.

> **Note:** This is a fundamental concept in computer graphics used in video games and interactive applications!

## Why Triangles?

The rasterization pipeline converts all primitives to triangles (even points and lines). Why?
- Can approximate any shape
- Always planar - have a well-defined plane passing through the 3 vertices, which is not true for other polygons
- Well-defined normal vector, which is very important for shading as we often need to know the normal direction
- Easy to interpolate data at corners using barycentric coordinates

The key reason: once everything is reduced to triangles, we can focus on making an extremely well-optimized pipeline for drawing them.

### **The Rasterization Pipeline: A Story of Turning Shapes into Pixels**  

Imagine youâ€™re an artist creating a 3D scene on a canvas (your screen). The rasterization pipeline is like an assembly line that takes your 3D models and converts them into the 2D pixels you see. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:  

---

### **1. Application Stage (The Blueprint)**  
- **Input:** Your 3D models (made of vertices, like the corners of a cube).  
- **What Happens:** The CPU prepares the dataâ€”positions, colors, texturesâ€”and sends it to the GPU. Think of this as sketching the outlines of your scene.  

---

### **2. Vertex Processing (Positioning Everything)**  
- **Input:** Raw 3D vertices (e.g., points in space).  
- **What Happens:**  
  - The GPU moves vertices into their correct positions (using transformations like rotation, scaling).  
  - Projects them onto the 2D screen (like a camera taking a photo).  
- **Output:** A list of vertices in screen coordinates.  

---

### **3. Triangle Processing (Building the Mesh)**  
- **Input:** Processed vertices.  
- **What Happens:**  
  - Vertices are connected into triangles (the basic building blocks of 3D shapes).  
  - Triangles are culled (discarded if theyâ€™re facing away or off-screen).  
- **Output:** A stream of triangles ready to be drawn.  

---

### **4. Rasterization (Breaking Triangles into Pixels)**  
- **Input:** Triangles in 2D screen space.  
- **What Happens:**  
  - The GPU scans each triangle and determines which pixels (or **samples**) it covers.  
  - Creates **fragments** (potential pixels with color, depth, etc.).  
- **Output:** A list of fragments (one for each pixel covered by a triangle).  

---

### **5. Fragment Processing (Painting the Pixels)**  
- **Input:** Fragments (not yet final pixels).  
- **What Happens:**  
  - Each fragment is shadedâ€”colors are applied, textures are added, lighting is calculated.  
  - Some fragments are discarded (if theyâ€™re behind other objects or transparent).  
- **Output:** Shaded fragments ready for the final image.  

---

### **6. Framebuffer Operations (The Final Touches)**  
- **Input:** Shaded fragments.  
- **What Happens:**  
  - Fragments are written to the **framebuffer** (the GPUâ€™s memory holding the final image).  
  - Depth testing ensures closer objects block farther ones.  
  - Transparency and blending are applied (like glass or smoke effects).  
- **Output:** A fully rendered frame of pixels.  

---

### **7. Display (The Big Reveal!)**  
- The framebuffer is sent to your monitor, lighting up pixels to show your 3D scene as a 2D image.  

---

### **Summary: From Points to Pixels**  
1. **Vertices** (points) â†’ Positioned in 3D space.  
2. **Triangles** (shapes) â†’ Built from vertices.  
3. **Fragments** (potential pixels) â†’ Generated by scanning triangles.  
4. **Shaded Fragments** (colored pixels) â†’ Lit and textured.  
5. **Framebuffer** (final image) â†’ Ready to display.  

And just like that, your 3D world becomes the pixels on your screen! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
